## Why Moss?

- **Agent-operable** — Every mutation available in the dashboard is available via CLI and API. AI agents can manage your CRM autonomously.
- **Opinionated schema** — Contacts, companies, deals, interactions, follow-ups, commitments, and tags. No custom objects to configure.
- **Built for speed** — Full-text search across all entities, keyboard shortcuts in the dashboard, `--json` output in the CLI for scripting.
- **Workspace-based** — Invite your team, manage API keys, configure webhooks. Per-workspace pricing starting at $0/month.
