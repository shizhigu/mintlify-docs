# Moss Documentation

Moss is a CRM built for technical founders running 1-5 person B2B SaaS companies. It provides three first-class interfaces — **Dashboard**, **CLI**, and **API** — all with full mutation parity, so you can manage your pipeline from wherever you work.

## Why Moss?

- **Agent-operable** — Every mutation available in the dashboard is available via CLI and API. AI agents can manage your CRM autonomously.
- **Opinionated pipeline** — Fixed deal stages (`lead → prospect → negotiation → won → lost`), no custom objects to configure. Works out of the box.
- **Built for speed** — Full-text search across all entities, keyboard shortcuts in the dashboard, `--json` output in the CLI for scripting.
- **Zero onboarding fees** — No mandatory setup costs, no hidden charges. Just pick a plan and start.

## Pricing

Per-seat pricing. No free tier — every plan includes the full Moss experience.
