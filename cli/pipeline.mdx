description: View pipeline summary with deal counts and values by stage.

The pipeline summary gives you a quick snapshot of where all your deals stand — how many are in each stage and their total value.

## moss pipeline show

Display a summary of your deal pipeline — deal count and total value grouped by stage.

```bash
moss pipeline show
```

```
Stage          Deals    Value
────────────── ──────── ──────────
lead           12       $45,000
qualified      8        $120,000
proposal       5        $95,000
negotiation    3        $85,000
won            15       $340,000
lost           6        $28,000
```

```bash
moss pipeline show --json
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "lead": { "count": 12, "value": 45000 },
    "qualified": { "count": 8, "value": 120000 },
    "proposal": { "count": 5, "value": 95000 },
    "negotiation": { "count": 3, "value": 85000 },
    "won": { "count": 15, "value": 340000 },
    "lost": { "count": 6, "value": 28000 }
  }
}
```

No options — this command always shows the full pipeline for the active workspace.

<Tip>
Pipe to `jq` to extract specific stages: `moss pipeline show --json | jq '.data.negotiation'`
