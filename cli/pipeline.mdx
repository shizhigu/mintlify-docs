## moss pipeline show

Display a summary of your deal pipeline — deal count and total value grouped by stage.

```bash
moss pipeline show
```

```
Stage          Deals    Value
────────────── ──────── ──────────
lead           12       $45,000
prospect       8        $120,000
negotiation    3        $85,000
won            15       $340,000
lost           6        $28,000
```

```bash
moss pipeline show --json
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "lead": { "count": 12, "value": 45000 },
    "prospect": { "count": 8, "value": 120000 },
    "negotiation": { "count": 3, "value": 85000 },
    "won": { "count": 15, "value": 340000 },
    "lost": { "count": 6, "value": 28000 }
  }
}
```

No options — this command always shows the full pipeline for the active workspace.
