## Workspaces

A **workspace** is the top-level container for all your CRM data. Each workspace has its own contacts, deals, team members, and settings. You can belong to multiple workspaces and switch between them.

Every API request and CLI command operates within a single workspace context, determined by your authentication token or the `--workspace` flag.

## Contacts

Contacts are the people you interact with. Each contact has:

- **Name** (required), email, phone, title, company association
- **Tags** for categorization
- **Custom field** values
- A **search vector** for full-text search across name, email, and notes

Contacts can be linked to multiple deals and have an activity timeline showing all interactions, follow-ups, and deal changes.

## Companies

Companies represent organizations. A company has a name, domain, and can be associated with multiple contacts. When you link a contact to a company, all of that contact's deals appear in the company's context.

## Deals

Deals track revenue opportunities through a fixed pipeline. Each deal has:

- **Title** (required), value, and stage
- Links to one or more **contacts**
- An **activity timeline**

### Deal Stages

Deals progress through these stages:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `lead` | Initial contact, not yet qualified |
| `prospect` | Qualified, discovery or demo in progress |
| `negotiation` | Terms being negotiated |
| `won` | Deal closed successfully |
| `lost` | Deal did not close |

Stages are enforced at the application level (not database enums), making them easy to evolve in future versions. Use `moss deal move` or `PATCH /api/deals/:id/stage` to advance a deal.

## Interactions

Interactions are logged touchpoints with contacts — emails, calls, meetings, or notes. Each interaction records:

- **Type**: `email`, `call`, `meeting`, `note`
- **Contact** and optional **deal** association
- **Content** (free-text body)
- **Occurred at** timestamp

Interactions are immutable once created (no update endpoint) — you can only create or delete them.

## Follow-ups

Follow-ups are actionable reminders tied to contacts or deals. They have:

- **Title**, **due date**, and **priority** (`low`, `medium`, `high`)
- A **completed** flag
- Contact and optional deal association

Use `moss followup today` to see what's due today, or `moss followup overdue` to catch up on missed items.

## Commitments

Commitments track promises made to contacts — "I'll send the contract by Friday" or "We'll implement SSO by Q2." They differ from follow-ups in that they represent promises to others, not just internal reminders.

Each commitment has a title, description, due date, and completed status.

## Tags

Tags provide flexible categorization across contacts, companies, and deals. MossDesk uses a **polymorphic tagging** system — a single tag can be applied to any entity type via a join table.

Tags have a name and an optional color for display in the dashboard.

## Custom Fields

Custom fields let you extend the built-in schema with workspace-specific data. Each custom field defines:

- **Name** and **field type** (`text`, `number`, `date`, `boolean`, `select`)
- **Entity type** it applies to (contacts, companies, or deals)
- **Options** (for select fields)

Custom field values are stored per-entity and accessible via the API and CLI.

## Authentication

MossDesk supports two authentication methods:

### Session-based (Dashboard)

Browser sessions managed by Better Auth. Used automatically when you're signed into the dashboard. Not applicable for CLI or API integrations.

### API Key (CLI + API)

API keys are the primary auth method for programmatic access. Each key has:

- A **prefix** (`moss_k_`) for easy identification
- **Scopes** controlling what the key can access
- A **workspace** binding

Pass your API key via the `X-API-Key` header (API) or `--api-key` flag (CLI). Keys created in **Settings > API Keys** in the dashboard or via `moss key create`.

## Pagination

List endpoints return paginated results with this structure:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 25,
    "total": 142,
    "total_pages": 6
  }
}
```

Use `--page` and `--per-page` flags in the CLI, or `?page=` and `?per_page=` query parameters in the API.

## Search

MossDesk provides full-text search powered by PostgreSQL `tsvector` with GIN indexes. Search across contacts, companies, deals, and interactions with a single query:

```bash
moss search --q "acme enterprise"
```

The search endpoint returns results grouped by entity type, with relevance ranking.
